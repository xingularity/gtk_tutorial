[GTK+ How do I find which radio button is selected?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8812389/gtk-how-do-i-find-which-radio-button-is-selected)

## Notes:
* If I connect "find_which_button_in_group_activated" with "clicked" event, this function will be triggered twice. However,
this problem can be solved through connection with "released" event.
